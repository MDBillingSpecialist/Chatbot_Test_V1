Your supervisor will give you your daily work instructions, performance reviews,\nrecommend pay increases, and recommend hiring and termination. Your supervisor is also responsible\nfor worksite safety, discipline, and may issue warnings to correct behavior and safety issues. The\nsupervisor may also assist with accident investigations. Supervisors are responsible for safety in their\nrespective work areas. This includes safety training, safety equipment, enforcing safety procedures\nand providing discipline warnings for those who violate safety procedures or policy.\nEthics Code\nMD Billing will conduct its business honestly and ethically wherever operations are maintained. We\nstrive to improve the quality of our services, products, and operations and will maintain a reputation for\nhonesty, fairness, respect, responsibility, integrity, trust, and sound business judgment. Our managers\nand associates are expected to adhere to high standards of business and personal integrity as a\nrepresentation of our business practices.\nWe expect that officers, directors, and associates will not knowingly misrepresent the Company and\nwill not speak on behalf of the Company unless specifically authorized. The confidentiality of trade\nsecrets, proprietary information, and similar confidential commercially-sensitive information (i.e.\nfinancial or sales records/reports, marketing or business strategies/plans, product or services\ndevelopment, customer lists, patents, trademarks, etc.) about our Company or operations, or that of\nour customers or partners, is to be treated with discretion and only be disseminated on a need-to-know\nbasis (see policies relating to privacy).\nViolation of the Code of Ethics can result in discipline, up to and including termination of employment.\nThe degree of discipline imposed may be influenced by the existence of voluntary disclosure of any\nethical violation and whether or not the violator cooperated in any subsequent investigation.\n1\nMission Statement\nTo empower our team and partners to provide compassionate, individualized care,\neducation and research for communities we serve.\nValues: HEALED\nHumility\nExcellence\nAccountability\nLoyalty\nEducation\nDiversity\nGoals\nExcellent patient outcomes and satisfaction through multidisciplinary\ncollaboration and innovative clinical stewardship.\nTimely and accurate communication across the healthcare continuum.\nPursue high levels of alignment to achieve common goals with our partners.\nCreate a corporate culture that fosters team member engagement and personal\nsatisfaction.\nDeliver effective educational programs that advance and promote professional\ngrowth and development.\nContribute to the body of knowledge through high quality clinical research.\n2\nPolicies and Practices\nOpen Door Policy\nWe welcome suggestions for continued improvement and ideas for better ways to perform your job,\nproduce or sell the products or services of our Company, or meet customer and client needs. Discuss\nyour ideas with your supervisor or another member of the management team.\nWe also encourage you to offer any suggestions derived from seminars, journals, or other outside\nsources of information you believe would add value to the Company.\nUnderstand that any suggestions, innovations, inventions, or other matter created by you on work time\nor with Company tools or property are considered to be the property of the Company.\nEmployment At-Will\nYour employment with MD Billing is on an \u201cat-will\u201d basis. This means your employment may be\nterminated at any time, with or without notice, and with or without cause. Likewise, we respect your\nright to leave the Company at any time, with or without notice and with or without cause.\nNothing in this associate handbook or any other Company document should be understood as creating\na contract, guaranteed or continued employment, a right to termination only \u201cfor cause,\u201d or of any other\nguarantee of continued benefits or employment. Only the Chief Executive Officer has the authority to\nmake promises or negotiate with regard to guaranteed or continued employment, and any such\npromises are only effective if placed in writing and signed by the Chief Executive Officer.\nDisability Accommodation\nMD Billing complies with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), the Pregnancy Discrimination Act,\nand all applicable state and local fair employment practices laws and is committed to providing equal\nemployment opportunities to qualified individuals with disabilities (including pregnancy-related\ndisabilities). Consistent with this commitment, the Company will provide reasonable accommodation to\ndisabled associates if the reasonable accommodation would allow the individual to perform the\nessential\nfunctions of the job, unless doing so would create an undue hardship.\nIf you require accommodation because of your disability, notify your manager, supervisor, etc. When\nmaking your request for an accommodation, make sure to include relevant information, such as:\n\u2022 A description of the proposed accommodation.\n\u2022 The reason you need accommodation.\n\u2022 How the accommodation will help you perform the essential functions of your job\nAfter receiving your request, the Company will engage in an interactive dialogue with you to determine\nthe precise limitations of your disability and explore potential reasonable accommodations that could\novercome those limitations. The Company encourages you to suggest specific reasonable\naccommodations that you believe would allow you to perform your job. However, the Company is not\nrequired to make the specific accommodation requested by you and may provide an alternative\naccommodation, to the extent any reasonable accommodation can be made without imposing an\nundue hardship on the Company.\n3\nPregnant Worker Fairness Act\nAs required by the federal Pregnant Workers Fairness Act (PWFA), MD Billing will provide reasonable\naccommodations to employees and applicants with limitations related to pregnancy, childbirth or related\nmedical conditions, unless the accommodation will cause undue hardship to MD Billing\u2019 operations.\nAn associate may request accommodation due to pregnancy, childbirth or a related medical condition by\nsubmitting the request in writing to human resources (HR). The accommodation request should include an\nexplanation of the pregnancy-related limitations, the accommodation needed and any alternative\naccommodation(s) that might be reasonable. Depending on the nature of the accommodation, the individual\nmay be requested to submit a statement from a health care provider substantiating the need for the\naccommodation.\nUpon receipt of a request for accommodation, HR will contact the associate to discuss the request and\ndetermine if accommodation is reasonable and can be provided without significant difficulty or expense, i.e.,\nundue hardship.\nWhile the reasonableness of each accommodation request will be individually assessed, possible\naccommodations include allowing the individual to:\n\u2022 Sit while working.\n\u2022 Drink water during the workday.\n\u2022 Receive closer-in parking.\n\u2022 Have flexible hours.\n\u2022 Receive appropriately sized uniforms and safety apparel.\n\u2022 Receive additional break time to use the bathroom, eat and rest.\n\u2022 Take time off to recover from childbirth.\n\u2022 Be excused from strenuous activities and/or activities that involve exposure to compounds deemed\nunsafe during pregnancy.\nAn associate may request paid or unpaid leave as a reasonable accommodation under this policy; however,\nMD Billing will not require an associate to take time off if another reasonable accommodation can be\nprovided that will allow the associate to continue to work.\nMD Billing prohibits any retaliation, harassment or adverse action due to an individual's request for\naccommodation under this policy or for reporting or participating in an investigation of unlawful\ndiscrimination under this policy.\nReligious Accommodation\nMD Billing is dedicated to treating the religious diversity of all our associates equally and with respect.\nAssociates may request accommodation when their religious beliefs cause a deviation from MD Billing\u2019\ndress code, schedule, basic job duties, or other aspects of employment. The Company will consider\nthe request but reserves the right to offer its own accommodation to the extent permitted by law. Some,\nbut not all, of the factors that the Company will consider are cost, the effect that accommodation will\nhave on current established policies and the burden on operations, including other associates, when\ndetermining a reasonable accommodation. At no time will the Company question the validity of a\nperson\u2019s belief.\nReligious accommodation requests must be submitted to your immediate supervisor or the human\nresources department.\nThe Company will not discriminate or retaliate against any associate for requesting accommodation.\n4\nProhibiting Harassment and Discrimination\nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 applies to employers with 15 or more associates. The law\nprohibits discrimination in employment on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, or sex.\nSexual harassment is a form of sex discrimination that violates Title VII. Under existing Title VII case\nlaw, employers may reduce their exposure to liability under Title VII by establishing, disseminating, and\nenforcing an anti-harassment policy and complaint procedure.\nEqual Opportunity Statement\nMD Billing is committed to the principles of equal employment. We are committed to complying with all\nfederal, state, and local laws providing equal employment opportunities, and all other employment laws\nand regulations. It is our intent to maintain a work environment which is free of harassment,\ndiscrimination, or retaliation because of sex, gender, race, religion, color, national origin, physical or\nmental disability, genetic information, marital status, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, military\nservice, veteran status, or any other status protected by federal, state, or local laws. MD Billing is\ndedicated to the fulfillment of this policy in regard to all aspects of employment, including but not limited\nto recruiting, hiring, placement, transfer, training, promotion, rates of pay, and other compensation,\ntermination, and all other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment.\nMD Billing will conduct a prompt and thorough investigation of all allegations of discrimination,\nharassment, or retaliation, or any violation of the Company\u2019s Equal Employment Opportunity Policy in a\nconfidential manner. The Company will take appropriate corrective action, if and where warranted. The\nCompany prohibits retaliation against any associate who provides information about, complains, or\nassists in the investigation of any complaint of discrimination or violation of the Company\u2019s Equal\nEmployment Opportunity Policy.\nWe are all responsible for upholding the Company\u2019s Equal Employment Opportunity Policy and any\nclaimed violations of that policy should be brought to the attention of the human resource personnel.\nPolicy Against Workplace Harassment\nMD Billing has a strict policy against all types of workplace harassment, including sexual harassment\nand other forms of workplace harassment based upon an individual\u2019s sex, gender, race, religion, color,\nnational origin, physical or mental disability, marital status, age, sexual orientation, gender identity or\nany other status protected by federal, state or local laws.

As\nnecessary, the Company may monitor any incident of harassment or discrimination to assure the\ninappropriate behavior has stopped. In all cases, the Company will follow up as necessary to ensure\nno retaliation for making a complaint or cooperating with an investigation.\nPolicy Against Violence\nAs the safety and security of our associates, vendors, contractors, and the general public is in the best\ninterests of MD Billing, we are committed to working with our associates to provide a work environment\nfree from violence, intimidation, and other disruptive behavior.\nZero-Tolerance Policy\nThe Company has a zero-tolerance policy regarding workplace violence and will not tolerate acts or\nthreats of violence, harassment, intimidation, and other disruptive behavior, either physical or verbal,\nthat occurs in the workplace or other areas. This applies to management, co-workers, associates, and\nnon- associates such as contractors, customers, and visitors.\nWorkplace violence can include oral or written statements, gestures, or expressions that communicate\na direct or indirect threat of physical harm, damage to property, or any intentional behavior that may\ncause a person to feel threatened.\n6\nProhibited Conduct\nProhibited conduct includes, but is not limited to:\n\u2022 Physically injuring another person.\n\u2022 Threatening to injure a person or damage property by any means, including verbal, written,\ndirect, indirect, or electronic means.\n\u2022 Taking any action to place a person in reasonable fear of imminent harm or offensive contact.\n\u2022 Possessing, brandishing, or using a f irearm on Company property or while performing\nCompany business except as permitted by state law.\n\u2022 Violating a restraining order, order of protection, injunction against harassment, or other court\norder.\nReporting Incidents of Violence\nReport to your manager, supervisor, or Human Resources, in accordance with this policy, any behavior\nthat compromises the Company's ability to maintain a safe work environment.

In addition,\nyou will not be subject to discipline for, based on a reasonable belief, reporting a threat, or for\ncooperating in an investigation.\nIf you initiate, participate, are involved in retaliation, or obstruct an investigation into conduct prohibited\nby this policy, you will be subject to discipline, up to and including termination.\nIf you believe you have been wrongfully retaliated against, immediately report the matter to Human\nResources.\nConflict Resolution\nThe Company subscribes to the open-door policy. You may bring a complaint to your supervisor for\nresolution. When matters cannot be handled on an informal basis, the Company has established a\nformal procedure for a fair review of any work-related controversy, dispute, or misunderstanding. A\ncomplaint may be brought by one or more associates concerning any work-related problem where the\ncomplaint has not been satisfactorily resolved in an informal manner.\nStep 1: The complaint must be submitted in writing to the human resources department within three (3)\nworking days of the incident. A written request for a meeting must be submitted simultaneously.\nGenerally, a meeting will be held within seven (7) business days of the associate\u2019s request depending\nupon scheduling availability. Witnesses will be allowed as necessary. If the problem is not resolved\nduring this meeting, the human resources department will give the associate a written resolution within\nseven (7) business days from the day the meeting of all related parties is held. If the associate is not\nsatisfied, the associate may proceed to Step 2.\nStep 2: If the associate is not satisfied after Step 1, the associate may submit a written request for\nreview of the complaint and Step 2 solution to the Chief Operating Officer (COO) or designee. Such a\nrequest must be made within three (3) working days following the receipt of the Step 1 resolution. The\nCOO or appointed representative will review the complaint and proposed solution and may call a\nfurther meeting to explore the problem. This meeting is to be attended by the associate concerned, the\nassociate\u2019s immediate supervisor, and any other associate of the Company whom the aggrieved\nassociate chooses. The COO or appointed representative will render the final decision within ten (10)\nbusiness days after receiving the Step 2 request, assuming scheduling availability. The decision will be\n7\ngiven to the associate in writing and will become part of the associate's personnel file.\nAlternative Dispute Resolution\nMD Billing is committed to providing the best possible working conditions for its associates. Part of this\ncommitment is encouraging an open and frank atmosphere in which any problem, complaint,\nsuggestion, or question receives a timely response from supervisors and management. MD Billing\nstrives to ensure consistent and honest treatment of all associates, supervisors, and managers. All\nassociates are expected to treat each other with mutual respect. Associates are encouraged to offer\npositive and constructive criticism.\nProblems, disputes, or claims not resolved through the preceding problem resolution steps are subject\nto mediation. Mediation will be conducted in accordance with the Alternate Dispute Resolution (ADR)\nguidelines under Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (JAMS) Minimum Standards of Procedural\nFairness of Employment, and under the JAMS Arbitration Rules and Procedures.\nAssociates who choose to use mediation to resolve a problem will be expected to share the cost of\nmediation. A complete description of the Alternate Dispute Resolution is available from the human\nresource director for review. If you need assistance on personnel matters, employments issues, or\nhave a complaint, feel free to contact the human resource department.\nEmployment Status\nRegular Full-Time Status\nA regular full-time associate is an associate who has completed his or her introductory period and is\nregularly scheduled to work 30 hours per week. Unless stated otherwise, all the benefits provided to\nassociates are for regular full-time associates only. This includes vacation, holiday pay, health\ninsurance, and other benefits coverage.\nRegular Part-Time Status\nAny associate who works less than 30 hours per week is considered a part-time associate.

The associate is paid for\nactual hours worked and is not eligible for benefits.

An associate will change from temporary to regular status only if advised of such a\nchange in writing from the human resource department.\nExempt Associates\nIf you are classified as an exempt associate at the time of your hiring, you are not eligible for overtime\npay as otherwise required by federal, state, or local laws. If you have a question regarding whether you\nare an exempt or non-exempt associate, contact your supervisor for clarification.\nOutside Employment\nOutside employment that creates a conflict of interest or affects the quality or value of your work\nperformance or availability at the Company is prohibited. The Company recognizes that associates\nmay seek additional employment during off hours, but in these cases, expects that any outside\n8\nemployment will not affect job performance, work hours, or scheduling, or otherwise adversely affect\nthe associate\u2019s ability to effectively perform their duties. Any conflicts should be reported to your\nsupervisor. Failure to adhere to this policy may result in discipline up to and including termination.\nPersonal Data Changes\nIt is your obligation to provide the Company with all your current contact information, including current\nmailing address and telephone number. Please inform the Company of any changes to your marital or\ntax withholding status. Failure to do so may result in loss of benefits or delayed receipt of W-2 and\nother mailings.\nPersonnel and Medical Records\nThe Company maintains a personnel and medical file for every associate. Medical records will be kept\nseparately from other personnel files. Every effort will be made to keep your personnel and medical\nrecords confidential. Access is on a \u201cneed-to-know\u201d basis only. This includes, but is not limited to,\nsupervisors and others in management reviewing the file for possible promotion, transfer, or layoff.\nIf an associate wishes to review his or her personnel or medical file, they may do so after giving the\nCompany reasonable notice.

MD Billing requires 14 days for associates, 30\ndays for management and 90 days for providers, notice to be given in order for the associate to have\nleft in good standing. Associates will not be granted Paid Time Off during their notice period. Final\npaychecks for associates who quit without notice will receive final pay within the State required time\nperiod after the associate has notified MD Billing their intent not to continue working.\nExit Interview\nYou may be asked to participate in an exit survey when you leave the Company. The purpose of the\nexit survey is to provide management with greater insight into your decision to leave employment,\nidentify any trends requiring attention or opportunities for improvement, and to assist the Company in\ndeveloping effective recruitment and retention strategies. Your cooperation in the exit survey process is\nvalued and appreciated.\nPost-Employment Reference Policy\nOur Company policy is to provide prospective employers with references only for associates who have\nworked for the Company within the past three years.\nWe will provide prospective employers with the dates of employment and final job position of a former\nassociate. All references are to be given by Human Resources only.\nIf the former associate is requested to provide a prospective employer with additional information by\nway of reference, the associate must sign a form that holds the Company and the prospective\nemployer harmless from any claims related to any information provided in response to that reference.\n9\nCompensation and Benefits\nBenefit Policies\nHealth Insurance\nThe Company provides its regular full-time associates who have completed 60 days of employment\nwith health insurance availability. Associates have the option of dependent coverage at their own\nexpense.\nMedical plan benefits for eligible associates and their dependents are described in detail in the\nSummary Plan Description (SPD) that is available to all eligible associates. These benefits may be\ncanceled or changed at the discretion of the Company, unless otherwise required by law.\nHealth benefits during approved medical leaves are maintained by the Company on the same terms as\nif the associates continued to work. Please contact Human Resources for clarification. In such\ncircumstances, arrangements must be made by eligible associates to pay their share of the health\ninsurance premium on a monthly basis to maintain insurance coverage. Please contact the Human\nResources Department to determine the amount of your contribution. The Company\u2019s obligation to\nmaintain health benefits stops when:\n\u2022 An associate informs the Company of an intent not to return to work at the end of the leave\nperiod; or\n\u2022 An associate fails to return to work after 12 consecutive weeks of absence: or\n\u2022 An associate\u2019s premium contribution is past due.\nThe Company will be entitled to recover premiums paid to maintain health insurance coverage for an\nassociate who fails to return to work from leave.\nPlease understand that plan eligibility does not necessarily mean coverage for all medical treatments\nor procedures. In addition, under certain circumstances, such as annual benefit enrollment, you may\nbe responsible for contributing to the cost of increased premiums. This benefit, as well as other\nbenefits, may be canceled or changed at the discretion of the Company, unless otherwise required by\nlaw.\nIf you or a dependent become ineligible for benefits due to a change in work hours, or through a life\nevent, or you terminate employment with us, you may have the right to continue your medical benefits\nunder the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA). The Company will mail you\ninformation about your COBRA rights.\nLife Insurance\nAll regular full-time associates who have completed 60 days of employment are eligible for life\ninsurance provided by the Company.

Workers\u2019 compensation insurance coverage is paid for by the employer and governed\nby state law. The workers\u2019 compensation system provides for coverage of medical treatment and\nexpenses, occupational disability leave, rehabilitation services, as well as payment for lost wages due\nto work related injuries. If you are injured on the job, no matter how slightly, you are to report the\nincident immediately to your supervisor. Consistent with applicable state law, failure to report an injury\nwithin a reasonable period of time could jeopardize your claim for benefits.\nTo receive workers\u2019 compensation benefits, notify your supervisor immediately of your claim.

You will be required to submit a medical release before you can return to work.\nUnemployment Compensation Insurance\nUnemployment compensation insurance is paid for by the Company and provides temporary income\nfor associates who have lost their job under certain circumstances. Your eligibility for unemployment\ncompensation will, in part, be determined by the reasons for your separation from the Company.\n11\nNew Associates and Introductory Periods\nThe first ninety days of your employment is considered an introductory period. During this period, you\nwill become familiar with MD Billing and your job responsibilities. During this time, we will have the\nopportunity to monitor the quality and value of your performance and make any necessary adjustments\nin your job description or responsibilities. Your introductory period with the Company can be shortened\nor lengthened as deemed appropriate by management and Human Resources. Completion of this\nintroductory period does not imply guaranteed or continued employment. Nothing that occurs during or\nafter this period should be construed to change the nature of the \u201cat-will\u201d employment relationship.\nAll new hires and current associates are required by federal law to verify their identity and eligibility to\nwork in the United States. You will be required to complete federal Form I-9 on the first day of\nemployment. If this form and verification of employment eligibility is not completed during the first three\ndays of employment, we are required by law to terminate your employment. If you are currently\nemployed and have not complied with this requirement or if your status has changed, please inform\nyour supervisor.\nforms will be maintained separately from personnel f iles and retained according to the U.S. Citizenship\nand Immigration Services (USCIS) retention requirements: I-9 forms should be retained for three years\nafter the date of hire or one year after the date employment ends ---- whichever is later. Current\nassociates should always have a Form I-9 on file.\nClinical Associate Evaluations and Assessments\nAll eligible associates are required to complete their 90-day clinical skills competency checklist before\ntheir initial 90-day period ends. The associates who are not able to complete it in the stipulated time-\nperiod may be suspended without pay or terminated. Similarly, all eligible associates are required to\ncomplete their clinical skills competency checklist annually. Associates who are not able to complete it\nin the stipulated time-period may be suspended without pay or terminated.\nProgram Director(s) are required to turn in your 90-day clinical skills competency checklist before 60\ndays of the associate\u2019s initial period. The remaining 30 days can be utilized, if there is any discrepancy\non associate\u2019s part related to the clinical competency skills, to train the particular associate in order for\nthem to develop their clinical skill(s) competency in the respective area so that the 90-day clinical skills\ncompetency checklist can be completed by 90 days from the date of hire. Similarly, the Program\nDirector(s) are required to turn in your Annual clinical skills competency checklist a month before the\nassociate completes their anniversary with the company.\nAssociates will be evaluated on the basis of their performance for their 90-day introductory period (for\nnew hires) and on an annual basis.

The performance\nimprovement process will take place on an as needed basis. Associates may specifically request that\ntheir supervisor assist in developing a performance improvement plan at any time.\nThe performance improvement process is a means for increasing the quality and value work\n12\nperformance. Initiative, effort, attitude, job knowledge, and other factors will be addressed. You must\nunderstand that a positive job performance review does not guarantee a pay raise or continued\nemployment. Company pay raises and promotions are based on numerous factors, only one of which\nis job performance.\nPromotions\nPromotions may occur when:\n\u2022 A job opening is internally or externally advertised\n\u2022 A position opens unexpectedly, and the Company wishes to f ill it f rom within\n\u2022 An associate has consistently good performance evaluations and possesses the attitude and\nleadership abilities that deem them ready for the next step in their career.\n\u2022 An associate acquires a credential (degree, licensure, etc.) that allows them to advance\nPromotions are made on an equal opportunity basis according to associates who possess the merit\nand desired skills, education, experience, and other qualifications required for the position. It is the\nCompany\u2019s policy to promote from within the Company when the most qualified candidate is available.\nAll associates promoted into new job positions will undergo a 90-day introductory period as described\nin the New Associates and Introductory Periods section. However, such associates will continue to\nreceive Company benefits for which they are eligible.\nThe company will use its best efforts to match each position with the talent most suitable for the job. As\na result, an associate could be transferred to a new position to ensure the best fit possible for the\nassociate and Company needs.\nIn accordance with our company policies, we will not tolerate promotions based on subjective opinions\nunsupported by performance evaluations, discrimination, favoritism, or nepotism. Managers must keep\ngood documentation of their promotion evaluation process to avoid such incidents.\nPay Raises\nDepending on the Company\u2019s financial health and other factors, efforts will be made to give pay raises\nconsistent with Company profitability, job performance, and the consumer price index. MD Billing may\nalso make individual pay raises based on merit or due to a change of job position or duties assigned.\nAssociates who are under corrective action are not eligible for a merit or cost-of-living wage increase.\nTransfer\nMD Billing may transfer your employment from one position to another with or without notice as\nrequired by production or service needs or upon request by an associate and management approval.\nTransfers in excess of 90 days may be considered final, and your paycheck may be increased or\ndecreased consistent with the pay scale for your new position.\nWorkforce Reductions (Layoffs)\nIf necessary, based upon the needs of the business, management may decide to implement a\nreduction in force (RIF). We acknowledge that RIFs can be a trying experience for management and\nassociates alike, and the Company will make its best effort to make sound business decisions while\nacknowledging the needs of its workforce.\nWage and Hours Policies\nAn associate\u2019s pay depends on a wide range of factors, including pay scale surveys, individual effort,\n13\nprofits, and market forces. If you have any questions about your compensation, including matters such\nas paid time off, commissions, overtime, benefits, or paycheck deductions, please speak with your\nsupervisor or Human Resources.\nRevenue Share Compensation\nRevenue-based wage is compensation calculated based on payment received from professional services\npersonally provided. Revenue-based compensation is paid semi-monthly in accordance with our current\npayroll schedule. Associates who have terminated employment, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, will\nreceive payment of collections for an additional 30 days following the date of separation from the Company\nregardless of outstanding accounts receivable which may yet to be collected.\nBonus Compensation\nBonuses are monetary rewards outside of an associate\u2019s usual pay or salary that they receive after\nmeeting or exceeding certain performance expectations.\nBonus compensation calculations will occur on a quarterly basis, based upon a regular calendar year\nquarterly schedule. Any such additional compensation due will be paid to within 30 days following the end\nof the prior quarter. Associates must be employed at the time of the bonus payout to be eligible. Bonus\ncompensation thresholds may be adjusted annually to account for inflation and adjusted at the same time\nassociate cost of living adjustments are made (if any).\nHoliday Differential Compensation\nA holiday differential of one-half the Associate\u2019s hourly rate will be paid to all non-exempt Associates who\nwork the actual day of any of the MD Billing officially designated holidays: New Year\u2019s Day, Memorial Day,\nIndependence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day.\nWorking the Monday or Friday when the actual holiday falls on a weekend does not entitle the Associate to\nholiday pay.\nPROCEDURES\n\u2022 Managers/Directors should ensure only those Associates required/scheduled to work a holiday are\non duty and receiving the holiday differential.\n\u2022 Associates should clock in and out the same as a normal shift.\n\u2022 Holiday differential will be paid for time worked from 12 a.m. to 11:59 p.m. on the actual holiday.\nThe differential is automatically calculated through the timekeeping system.\nWork Schedules\nAll work schedules will be determined by your immediate supervisor.\nTime Keeping\nFederal and state laws require us to keep accurate records of hours worked by non-exempt (hourly)\nassociates. You should clock in no more than five minutes ahead of time and clock out no later than\nfive minutes after your quitting time. Every non-exempt associate of the Company is required to enter\ntheir hours worked accurately, including all lunch periods and any rest periods of more than 20\nminutes.\nAssociates are required to notify the company of any pay discrepancies, unrecorded or mis-recorded\nwork hours, or any involuntary missed meal or break periods.\nDo not complete the time sheet of any other associate or request that they do so for you. Please be\nsure to indicate your days off. Any changes to your timecard must be approved of by your supervisor.\nTimecard adjustments are to be initiated in the time keeping system within 24 hours of the discrepancy.\n14\nFalsification of time records or recording time for another associate may result in discipline, up to and\nincluding termination of employment.\nALL hourly associates are required to clock in and out for the day and for lunch on a daily basis. It is\nthe associate\u2019s responsibility to check their punches daily to determine if there are any missed punches\nor discrepancies.\nIf an associate has a missed punch or discrepancy, they must submit a time adjustment to their\nsupervisor within 24 hours of when the missed punch or discrepancy occurred. Supervisors must\napprove time adjustments. All time adjustments must be approved within 24 hours of receiving the\nrequest.\nIf for any reason the associate\u2019s supervisor is absent, the associate must inform the Human Resources\nDepartment within 24 hours of when the missed punch or discrepancy occurred.\nExtenuating circumstances where an associate or supervisor is unable to meet the requirements of the\npolicy will be managed on a case-by-case basis.\nAll associates, regardless of position, are required to adhere to these guidelines. Failure to follow these\nguidelines will result in disciplinary action up to and including termination.\nRest and Meal Periods\nThe Company strives to provide a safe and healthy work environment and complies with all federal and\nstate regulations regarding rest and meal periods. Please check with your supervisor regarding\nprocedures and schedules for rest and meal breaks. The Company requests that associates accurately\nobserve and record meal and rest periods. If you know in advance that you may not be able to take\nyour scheduled break or meal period, please let your supervisor know as soon as possible. If you did\nnot know in advance but were unable to take a meal or rest break, please notify your supervisor as\nsoon as possible.\nOff The Clock Work\nUnder the Fair Labor Standards Act, non-exempt associates must be paid for all hours worked.\nPerforming any work-related tasks must only take place during assigned work periods while hours\nworked are being recorded. MD Billing does not allow work to be performed outside of assigned work\nperiods without pay to any non-exempt team members. Supervisor approval is required for all work\noutside of normal and/or beyond the 40-hour work week. Violation of this policy will result in disciplinary\naction up to and including termination of employment.\nOvertime Authorization for Non-exempt Associates\nIf you are a non-exempt associate, you may qualify for overtime pay. All overtime must be approved in\nadvance, in writing, by your supervisor.\nAt certain times, the Company may require you to work overtime. We will attempt to give as much\nnotice as possible in this instance. However, advance notice may not always be possible. Failure to\nwork overtime when requested or working unauthorized overtime may result in discipline, up to and\nincluding termination of employment.\nOvertime pay of one and one-half times an associate\u2019s regular rate of pay or average pay rate (if you\nperform work at different pay rates during the relevant week) is paid for any hours worked in excess of\n40 hours in a workweek. Holidays, Paid Time Off and other non-working leave days do not count as\ntime worked for computing overtime.\n15\nRemote Work Policy\nEmployees are permitted to work remotely occasionally or regularly, depending on a number of factors and\nthe arrangements they've made with their manager. Remote work is a privilege that may be revoked at any\ntime. The Company may request that an employee be present in the office at any time (regardless of\nscheduled time) or deny a request to work remotely based on business needs, employee performance, or\nviability of doing the remotely. To be eligible, an employee must have access to reliable internet and a\nspace that is free from excessive noise or distraction.\nSubmitting Requests\nEmployees who do not have a remote work agreement in place must submit a remote work request in\nwriting to their supervisor and notify appropriate team members.

For purposes of this policy, the\nregular workday is 8:00 \u2013 5:00 (Monday \u2013 Friday).\nHome to Work Travel\nAn associate who travels from home before the regular workday and returns to his or her home at the\nend of the workday is engaged in ordinary home to work travel, which is not work time.\nHome to Work on a Special One Day Assignment in Another City\nAn associate who regularly works at a fixed location in one city is given a special one-day assignment\nin another city and returns home the same day. The time spent in traveling to and returning from the\nother city is work time, except that the employer may deduct/not count that time the associate would\nnormally spend commuting to the regular work site.\nTravel That Is All in a Day\u2019s Work\nTime spent by an associate in travel as part of their principal activity, such as travel from job site to job\nsite during the workday, is work time and must be counted as hours worked.\nTravel Away from Home Community\nTravel that keeps an associate away from home overnight is travel away from home. Travel away from\nhome is clearly work time when it cuts across the associate\u2019s workday. The time is not only hours\nworked on regular working days during normal working hours but also during corresponding hours on\nnonworking days. MD Billing will not consider as work time that time spent in travel away from home\noutside of regular working hours as a passenger on an airplane, train, boat, bus, or automobile.\nCalculating and Reporting Travel Time\nAssociates are responsible for accurately tracking, calculating, and reporting travel time.

Vehicle class\nshould accommodate only the business needs for travel, any reservation above the Standard class\nvehicle requires administrative approval.\nPersonal Vehicles\nAll associates using their own vehicle for business purposes must maintain insurance coverage as\nrequired by law and may not have more than 2 points on their driving record. Travel between the\nassociate\u2019s home and primary office is not considered to be business travel. Associates are not\nauthorized to use personal vehicles for business travel without authorization. Associates will be\nreimbursed for vehicle use at the current company rate. An executive officer must authorize any\ndeviation from this policy.\nTravel to a temporary location within a metro area (50-mile radius from home site) will not be subject to\nmileage reimbursement except in cases where the associate has reported to one location and has\nbeen requested to report to a separate location in the same day. The route chosen for reimbursement\nshould be the shortest route available. If a company vehicle is available for such travel, associates\nshould use a company vehicle. If a company vehicle is available and the associate chooses not to use\nit, no mileage reimbursement will be offered for that trip.\nAssociate Reporting\nAssociates are to report their expenses for approval through the appropriate reporting tools and must\ninclude a description of the expense, its business purpose, date, place, and the participants.\nBusiness Expenses\nApproved business expenses are the reasonable and necessary expenses incurred by associates to\nachieve legitimate business purposes that are not covered by normal Company procurement\nprocesses.\nAll business expenses must be approved by your supervisor prior to occurrence.\nBusiness Meetings (Company-Sponsored Events and Meetings)\nThe Company pays for expenses necessary to achieve a valid business purpose when meetings are\nheld with customers, vendors, or other Company associates. The most senior Company associate\npresent is to pay and report all expenses.\nThe Company will make every effort to have a master account set up for Company -wide and large\ngroup events. However, if you are at a small meeting or staying by yourself at a hotel, pay individually\nand submit for reimbursement accordingly.\n18\nEntertainment\nThe Company pays for entertainment expenses only when they clearly benefit the Company and\ninclude customers and are promotional in nature.

Any credit card the Company issues to an associate must be used for\nbusiness purposes only, in conjunction with the associate\u2019s job duties. Associates with such credit\ncards shall not use them for any non-business, non-essential purpose, i.e., for any personal purchase\nor any other transaction that is not authorized or needed to carry out their duties. Associates must pay\nfor personal purchases (i.e. transactions for the benefit of anyone or anything other than the Company)\nwith their own funds or personal credit cards.\nThe Company will not regard expenses for one's own business-related use, such as lodging and meals\nwhile on company-approved business trips, as personal purchases, as long as such expenses are\nconsistent with the Company's travel and expense reimbursement policy.\nIf any associate uses a company credit card for personal purchases in violation of this policy, the cost\nof such purchase(s) will be considered an advance of future wages payable to that associate and will\nbe recovered in full from the associate\u2019s next paycheck; any balance remaining will be deducted in full\nfrom subsequent paychecks until the wage advance is fully repaid. Such deductions may not take the\nassociates pay below minimum wage for the pay period(s) in question. If an associate uses a company\ncredit card for any other type of unauthorized transaction in violation of this policy, i.e., incurs financial\nliability on the Company's part that is not within the scope of the associate\u2019s duties or the associate\u2019s\nauthorization to make business-related purchases, the cost of such purchase(s) or transaction will be\nthe financial responsibility of that associate, and the associate will be expected to reimburse the\nCompany via deductions from pay until the unauthorized amount is fully repaid. Such deductions will\nbe in the amount of the unauthorized purchase(s), but if a deduction for such amount would take the\nassociate below minimum wage for the work week in question, the deductions will be in two or more\nequal increments that will not take the associate's pay below minimum wage for any work week\ninvolved.\nIn addition to financial responsibility and liability for wage deductions, any purchases an associate\nmakes with a company credit card in violation of this policy will result in disciplinary action, up to and\npossibly including termination of employment, depending upon the severity and repeat nature of the\noffense.\nTerms of use are as follows:\n19\n1.

All requests for payroll advances or\nloans from the Company will be rejected.\nAttendance and Leave\nAttendance Policy\nThe purpose of this policy is to set forth MD Billing' policy and procedures for handling associate\nabsences and tardiness to promote the efficient operation of the company and minimize unscheduled\nabsences.\nPunctual and regular attendance is an essential responsibility of each associate at MD Billing.\nAssociates are expected to report to work as scheduled, on time and prepared to start working.\nAssociates also are expected to remain at work for their entire work schedule. Late arrival, early\ndeparture or other absences from scheduled hours are disruptive and must be avoided.\nThis policy does not apply to absences covered by the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) or leave\nprovided as a reasonable accommodation under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). These\nexceptions are described in separate policies.\nAbsence\n\"Absence\" is defined as the failure of an associate to report for work when they are scheduled to work.\nThe two types of absences are defined below:\nExcused absence occurs when all the following conditions are met:\n\u2022 The associate provides to his or her supervisor sufficient notice at least 48 hours in advance of\nthe absence.\n\u2022 The absence request is approved in advance by the associate's supervisor.\n\u2022 The associate has sufficient accrued paid time off (PTO) to cover the absence.\nUnexcused absence occurs when any of the above conditions are not met; all above conditions must\nbe satisfied in order for the absence to be considered excused.\n\u2022 An associate who must call in the day of their shift must do so a minimum of two hours prior to\nthe start of their shift. With exception of extenuating circumstances, do not contact your\nsupervisor between the hours of ten o\u2019clock pm and f ive o\u2019clock am. Associates should call in\nto their supervisor and leave a message for the Human Resources department as a backup.\n21\nAn unexcused absence counts as one occurrence for the purposes of discipline under this\npolicy.\n\u2022 Associates with two or more consecutive days of unexcused absences because of illness or\ninjury must give MD Billing proof of physician's care and a fitness for duty release prior to\nreturning to work.\n\u2022 Associates must take earned PTO for every absence unless otherwise allowed by company\npolicy (e.g., leave of absence, bereavement, jury duty).\nTardiness and Early Departures\nAssociates are expected to report to work and return from scheduled breaks on time. If associates\ncannot report to work as scheduled, they must notify their supervisor no later than their regular starting\ntime. This notification does not excuse the tardiness but simply notifies the supervisor that a schedule\nchange may be necessary.\nAssociates who must leave work before the end of their scheduled shift must notify a supervisor\nimmediately.\nTardiness and early departures are each one-half an occurrence for the purpose of discipline under\nthis policy.\nDisciplinary Action\nExcessive absenteeism is defined as two or more occurrences of unexcused absence in a 30 -day\nperiod or three or more occurrences in a 90-day period and will result in disciplinary action. Eight\noccurrences of unexcused absence in a 12-month period are considered grounds for termination.\nOccurrence\nUnscheduled absences that consist of 1-3 consecutive calendar days missed or absent from work for\nthe same illness/reason. For unscheduled absences in excess of 3 days the associate should consider\nrequesting leave under a qualifying company leave policy (see Leave of Absence Policy).\nIn the event an associate is forced to leave their scheduled shift early due to illness/emergency and\nthen calls in for their shift in the following consecutive days, only one occurrence will be counted.\nAssociates who return to work after and unscheduled occurrence but then find that they are unable to\nperform their job duties due to the same illness/emergency may extend their unscheduled absence\nunder the same occurrence.\nJob Abandonment\nAny associate who fails to report to work for a period of one day or more without notifying his or her\nsupervisor will be considered to have abandoned the job and voluntarily terminated the employment\nrelationship. Associates who abandon their job will not be eligible for re-hire.\nPaid Time Off (PTO)\nPurpose of Paid Time Off (PTO)\nThe purpose of Paid Time Off (PTO) is to provide associates with flexible paid time off from work\nthat can be used for such needs as vacation, holidays, personal or family illness, doctor\nappointments, school, volunteerism, and other activities of the associate's choice. The company's\ngoal is to reduce unscheduled absences and the need for supervisory oversight.\nGuidelines for PTO Use\nAssociates are responsible for managing their PTO account. It is important to reserve time for\nholidays, vacations, doctors appointments, personal business, short-term illnesses and unexpected\nabsences. Associates may not use PTO hours before they are accrued and reflected in the payroll\nsystem.\n22\nEach full-time associate will accrue PTO semi-monthly in hourly increments based on their length of\nservice as defined below. PTO is added to the associate's PTO bank when the semi-monthly\npaycheck is issued. PTO taken will be subtracted from the associate's accrued time bank in one-\nhour increments.Only full-time associates are eligible for PTO accrual.\nEligibility to accrue PTO is contingent on the associate either working or utilizing accrued PTO for\nthe entire semi-monthly pay period. PTO accruals are adjusted down proportionally for pay\nperiods during which unpaid leave, including disciplinary leave, short- or long-term disability leave\nor workers' compensation leave are taken.\nAssociates may use time from their PTO bank in hourly increments. Time that is not covered by the\nPTO policy, and for which separate guidelines and policies exist, include bereavement time off,\nrequired jury duty, and military service leave.\nAll PTO requests should be submitted through Paycom at least twenty-one days in advance of the\nrequested time off except when being requested for legitimate, unexpected illness or emergencies.\nIn those instances, the Associate must notify his/her manager at least two {2) hours before the start\nof the Associate's shift,or according to departmental procedures, except in emergency circumstances\nwhen such contact is not feasible. In those instances, notification should take place as soon as\npossible. (Use the Paid Time Off online request system to request PTO.) In all instances, PTO must\nbe approved by the associate's supervisor in advance. The Company appreciates as much notice as\npossible when you know you expect to miss work for a scheduled absence.\nManagers should review and approve/deny PTO requests within the Paycom system\non a daily basis. Notification of the approval/denial will be sent to the Associate email or\nPaycom push notification system. When necessary, if patient safety and care or critical\nbusiness operations will be impacted by the Associate's absence, MD Billing reserves the right\nto cancel approved PTO.\nPaid Time Off (PTO) Exceptions\n\u2022 Associates who miss two or more consecutive unscheduled days may be required to present a\ndoctor's release to the Human Resources department that permits them to return to work.\n\u2022 Newly-hired Associates will begin accruing PTO on their first day of employment, but they will\nnot be able to use their PTO during the introductory period.\n\u2022 PTO taken in excess of the PTO accrued can result in progressive disciplinary action up to and\nincluding termination of employment. Time off in excess of accrued or advanced PTO will be\nunpaid. The only possible exception to this policy must be granted by the company CEO.\n\u2022 PTO accrued prior to the start of a requested and approved unpaid leave of absence must be\nused to cover hours missed before the start of the unpaid leave.\n\u2022 Unscheduled absences of four hours or more due to illnesses, which result in consecutive days\nabsent from work, are considered one absence incident in relationship to potential disciplinary\naction.\n\u2022 The combination of worked hours, non-worked paid hours and PTO hours should not exceed\nthe number of hours the Associate is normally authorized to work in a workweek, up to a\nmaximum of 40 hours. Example: If an Associate would have normally been scheduled to\n23\nwork 36 hours that week, the total number of hours paid, including PTO, may not exceed 36.\nSpecific Eligibility for Paid Time Off (PTO)\nPTO is earned on the following schedule. PTO is accrued based on full-time pay periods worked,\nwithout regard for overtime hours worked.\nYears of Service:\n\u2022 0-1 years: Up to 128 PTO hours accruable per year, earned at an hourly rate of 0.0615\nPTO hours per hour worked\n\u2022 1-3 years: Up to 168 PTO hours accruable per year, earned at an hourly rate of 0.0807\nPTO hours per hour worked\n\u2022 4+ years: Up to 208 PTO hours accruable per year, earned at a rate of 0.1 PTO hours\nper hour worked\nSalary associates who take a full day of PTO must be deducted 8 hours of PTO regardless of\ntypical actual hours worked in a day.\nEach associate may carry over no more than their maximum amount of accrued PTO on their\nanniversary date of hire. For example, an associate that has been with the company for two years\nmay carry over no more than 168 PTO hours into their third year of employment. Associates are\nresponsible for monitoring and taking their PTO so that they do not lose time accrued when their\nanniversary occurs (PTO is always subject to supervisory approval).\nIf extenuating business circumstances prevented the associate from taking scheduled PTO, this\nPTO may be carried over with Chief Officer approval if it is in excess of the maximum allowable\ncarry over amount and is taken in the subsequent 3 calendar months.\nNon-Exempt Associates may use PTO as described below:\n\u2022 PTO hours will be paid at the Associate's base rate\n\u2022 If the Associate does not have enough PTO to cover time taken off from work, that time will be\nunpaid.\n\u2022 After the Introductory Period (as discussed above), non-exempt Associates are required to use any\navailable PTO to cover missed hours, before taking time off without pay. This requirement\nexcludes any time missed due to flexing/low census or when the Associate's department or\nlocation is closed due to inclement weather; in these instances, the Associate may choose to use\navailable PTO or take time off without pay.\nExempt Associates may use PTO as described below:\n\u2022 Exempt Associates are paid on a salaried basis and, if some hours are worked in a day, salary is\ncontinued with the appropriate PTO deduction applied. An exempt Associate must take PTO to\ncover personal absences. PTO may be taken only in increments of a full day (8 hours) or one-half\nday (4 hours). While no PTO will be deducted for an absence less than 4 hours in a single day,\nsuch absences should be limited and pre-approved.\n\u2022 If an exempt Associate has fewer than 4 hours of PTO and takes a half day of absence, then 100%\nof the balance of the Associate's PTO hour bank will be withdrawn and the Associate's salary\nfor the day will continue without a deduction.\n24\n\u2022 If an exempt Associate wishes to take a full day off work, he or she must have at least 8 hours\nof PTO for the absence to be paid. If an exempt Associate has fewer than 8 hours of PTO and\nwishes to take a full day of absence, then the Associate must take a full day off without pay.\n\u2022 When an exempt Associate is on intermittent or reduced schedule leave under the Family and\nMedical leave Act (FMLA), MD Billing may pay the Associate PTO in any increment for the\ntime that the Associate is away from work due to the FMLA-protected condition. If no PTO is\navailable, MD Billing may deduct the Associate's salary accordingly.\n\u2022 Deductions may be made from an exempt Associate's compensation to account for absences in\nfull day increments only if the Associate has exhausted his or her PTO allowance.\n\u2022 These procedures assume the exempt Associate works a regular shift of five days per week. If the\nAssociate works any other schedule, the amount of PTO required for half day absences should\nequal one-half the Associate's regular shift. Example: If an Associate's schedule is four 10-hour days\nper week, the Associate should take PTO in increments of five hours.\n\u2022 Frequent unscheduled absences or other abuse of these guidelines may result in disciplinary\naction up to and including termination.\n\u2022 Generally, the maximum PTO approved at a time for personal reasons, other than medical\ncircumstances, will be two weeks, subject to management approval. Additional PTO may be\nrequested and approved for special circumstances.\nHolidays/ Family & Cultural Days\nPTO is designed to cover time off for holidays and family and cultural days. Non-exempt Associates\nmay choose whether to use available PTO or to take the day off without pay. Exempt Associates must\nuse PTO in the same process outlined above.\nUnless MD Billing has determined an Associate's work is business critical and time- sensitive, and\nsuch work is approved by the department's senior leadership, Associates may be required to take off\nwork on the following holidays:\n\u2022 New Years Day\n\u2022 Memorial Day\n\u2022 Independence Day\n\u2022 Labor Day\n\u2022 Thanksgiving Day\n\u2022 Christmas Day\nAssociates working on a holiday may be eligible for additional compensation as defined in the\nHoliday Differentials Policy.\nFamily and cultural days support MD Billing commitment to diversity and inclusion allowing Associates time\noff for other holidays that are important to them and their families. Unless MD Billing has determined an\nAssociate's work is business critical and time-sensitive, Associates may request up to four days per calendar\nyear for other family and cultural days.\nAssociates may be asked to provide a description of the day for which they are requesting time off and\nthe request must be scheduled and approved in advance by the Associate's manager.\nAssociates working on a family or cultural holiday are not eligible for additional compensation.\n25\nTypically, holidays and family or cultural days falling on Saturday will be observed on Friday and\nholidays falling on Sunday will be observed on Monday.\nThe manager is responsible for scheduling work on holidays according to business and consumer\nneeds. Managers should respect the request for time off for family and cultural days and make\nefforts to accommodate the requests unless a compelling business need exists that would cause the\nAssociate's absence to be detrimental to operations and no replacement is available.\nStatus Changes\nIf an associates status changes from full-time to full-time revenue share, part-time, or PRN the\nassociates PTO balance will be forfeited. Balances will not be maintained for future use in any status\noutside of regular full-time status.\nVoluntary Separation\nAssociates who voluntarily separate from employment will forfeit any remaining Paid Time Off balance.\nThe Company will not pay out any PTO balance.\nAssociates will not be permitted to cash out their earned hours of PTO.\nGenerally, Associates who have given notice of resignation may not utilize their PTO benefits during\nthe notice period.\nPTO hours may not be used to extend employment beyond the last day actually worked.\nIf an associate has used PTO time not yet accrued, and employment terminates, the PTO taken will be\ndeducted from the final paycheck. Associates who give notice of employment termination must work\nwithout utilizing PTO during the entirety of the notice period.\nRehires\nIf an associate separates from employment and is rehired within 30 days, the associate\u2019s previous date of\nhire will be used for purposes of PTO determination.\nOther Time Off\nThese guidelines do not cover all absences. An Associate may also be eligible for jury duty leave,\nbereavement leave, unpaid Family Medical Leave Act leave, Short or Long- Term Disability benefits, and\nother time according to MD Billing policies and guidelines.\nCompensatory Time Off Policy\nIt is the policy of MD Billing to permit exempt employees who work more hours than regularly scheduled to\nreceive compensatory time off.\nGranting Compensatory Time Off\nCompensatory time off is granted to exempt positions. There is no legal requirement or obligation for MD\nBilling to grant compensatory time off to exempt employees. A supervisor may choose to grant\ncompensatory time off to exempt employees who are required to work in excess of 50 hours or more in a\nweek for a special project or during weekends or any normally scheduled time off. Compensatory time will\nbe granted on a discretionary basis and shall not be more than an hour-for-hour basis of time work, but,\nshall not necessarily be an hour-for-hour basis.\nUsing Compensatory Time Off\nAn employee who eligible for compensatory time and requests use of the time will only be permitted to use\nthe time within the same pay period or the subsequent pay period. Approval for use of compensatory time\nwill be solely at the supervisor's discretion and with final approval from human resources. Compensatory\ntime will not accrue in any manner to the employee\u2019s benefit otherwise.\n26\nEmergency Closings\nAt times, emergencies such as severe weather, fires, power failure, or acts of God, can disrupt\ncompany operations. In extreme cases, these circumstances may require the closing of a work facility.\nWhen operations are officially closed due to emergency conditions, non-exempt associates will not be\npaid for the time off from scheduled work. In cases where an emergency closing is not authorized,\nassociates who fail to report for work will not be paid for time off. Associates in essential operations\nmay be asked to work on a day when operations are officially closed. In these circumstances,\nassociates who work will receive regular pay.\nBereavement Leave\nObjective\nThe Bereavement Leave Policy establishes uniform guidelines for providing paid time off to associates\nfor absences related to the death of immediate family members and fellow associates or retirees of MD\nBilling.\nEligibility\nAll full-time, active associates are eligible for benefits under this policy after the ninety-day probationary\nperiod. If an associate is not eligible under these provisions the associate will be granted Leave\nWithout Pay.\nProcedures\nAn associate who wishes to take time off due to the death of an immediate family member should\nnotify his or her supervisor as soon as possible but in all instances prior to being absent from work. If\nan associate leaves work early on the day they are notified of the death, that day will not count as\nbereavement leave but will be paid as regular pay for salaried associates or hourly associates may\nutilize Paid Time Off benefits for this time.\nIn addition to bereavement leave, an associate may, with his or her supervisor's approval, use any\navailable paid time off for additional approved time off as necessary. Associates may be required to\nprovide documentation with regard to their bereavement leave.\nBereavement pay is calculated based on the base pay rate at the time of absence, and it will not\ninclude any special forms of compensation, such as incentives, commissions, bonuses, overtime or\nshift differentials.\nPaid bereavement leave will be granted according to the following schedule:\n\u2022 Associates are allowed up to three consecutive days off f rom regularly scheduled duty with\nregular pay in the event of the death of the associate's spouse, domestic partner, child,\nparent, father-in-law, mother-in-law, brother or sister.\n\u2022 Associates are allowed one day off f rom regular scheduled duty with regular pay in the event of\ndeath of the associate's grandparent, grandchild or spouse's grandparent.\n\u2022 Associates are allowed up to four hours of bereavement leave to attend the funeral of a fellow\nregular associate or retiree of the company, provided such absence f rom duty will not\ninterfere with normal operations of the company.\n27\nJury Duty Leave\nMD Billing encourages associates to fulfill their civic duties related to jury duty. If you are summoned\nfor jury duty, notify your supervisor as soon as possible to make scheduling arrangements.\nIf you are an exempt associate, you will not incur any deduction in pay for a partial week\u2019s absence\ndue to jury duty. If you are a non-exempt associate, you will be compensated for time spent on jury\nduty. All associates will be compensated for up to five days based on their regular compensation\nschedule. If jury service extends beyond five days, the associate will be compensated at a rate of 60%\nof their regular compensation schedule. The Company reserves the right to require associates to\nprovide proof of jury duty service to the extent authorized by law.\nThe Company will not retaliate against any associate who requests or takes leave in accordance with\nthis policy.\nCourt Attendance and Witness Leave\nMD Billing realizes that, on occasion, associates may be subpoenaed to appear in a civil, criminal,\nlegislative, or administrative proceeding. In such cases, you will be provided unpaid leave to attend.\nNotify your supervisor as soon as possible to make scheduling arrangements. You may opt to use PTO\nin place of unpaid leave.\nThe Company reserves the right to require associates to provide proof of the need for leave to the\nextent authorized by law.\nThe Company will not retaliate against any associate who requests or takes leave in accordance with\nthis policy.\nVoting Leave\nIf your work schedule prevents you from voting on Election Day, the Company will allow you a\nreasonable time off to vote. The time when you can go to vote will be at the discretion of your\nsupervisor, consistent with applicable legal requirements.\nLeave of Absence\nPURPOSE: The purpose of this policy is to set forth MD Billing. (MDB) leaves of absence in an\nintegrated manner. The policy addresses leaves of absence for the following reasons: (1) serious\nhealth condition; (2) pregnancy disability; (3) parenting; (4) family care; (5) personal; (6) military;\nand (7) other medical/reasonable accommodations. The policy also addresses the use of\nPaid/Extended Time Off.\n1. MDB leave of Absence Policy Outline: Provisions that Apply to Multiple Policies\n1.1 PAY WHILE ON LEAVE\n1.1.1 Leaves of absence are generally provided on an unpaid basis. Unless prohibited by\nlaw, associates are required to use all applicable Paid Time Off (PTO) while on\nleave.\n1.1.2 The substitution of any paid benefits does not extend the total amount of leave that\nmay be taken under system policy and applicable law. When paid benefits are\nexhausted, the remaining leave period will be unpaid.\n1.1.3 PTO will be paid until the balance drops below 1 hour.\n1.1.4 Accrued PTO hours must be taken at the rate of the regular work\nschedule, not exceeding 80 hours per pay period.\n28\n1.2 BENEFIT CONTINUATION WHILE ON LEAVE\n1.2.1 As allowed by law, group health insurance benefits will be continued for a maximum\nof 12 weeks; thereafter, associates may be eligible to continue benefits through a\nCOBRA\nprogram. If an associate has elected Supplemental Benefits, it is the associate\u2019s\nresponsibility to contact the appropriate provider to set-up direct bill.\n1.2.2 In the event there is less than ninety (90) days between an associate\u2019s return to work\nfrom one leave and the start date of another leave, the time spent on the prior leave\nwill be counted for purposes of determining the length of benefits continuation, where\nallowed by law. For example, if an associate is on medical leave for 1 month, returns\nto work for 60 days, and then takes another medical leave, they shall be entitled to\ntwo additional months of benefits coverage (i.e. for a total of 12 weeks) and then will\nbe eligible to continue benefits under the COBRA program.\n1.2.3 To the extent an associate is using accrued PTO, insurance premiums\nwill be automatically deducted from the associate\u2019s paycheck.\n1.2.4 If an associate\u2019s available paid time off is depleted or if the associate\u2019s paycheck is\ninsufficient to cover the total premium, the associate is responsible for the payment of\nthe remainder of the premium due.\n1.2.5 When an associate\u2019s pay is insufficient to pay for benefit premiums, s/he will be\nrequired to set up a payment arrangement with the HR department.\n1.2.6 Failure to pay a premium according to the timing agreed upon may result in\nthe termination of the associate\u2019s insurance coverage, and MDB may recover f\nrom the associate the costs of any health insurance premiums it has paid on\nbehalf of the associate.\n1.2.7 For purposes of retirement and savings plans, service credits during a leave of\nabsence will be determined under the appropriate plan documents.\n1.2.8 Associates\u2019 Basic Life Insurance coverage will be governed in accordance with the\nplan document.\n1.3 JOB PROTECTION WHILE ON LEAVE\n1.3.1 Job protection varies by type of leave. See the detailed leave policies for\nmore information.\n1.3.2 Under all policies, if an associate\u2019s position is eliminated or otherwise ceases to\nexist while on leave (for example, as part of a reduction-in-force), the leave may be\nterminated and the associate\u2019s right to return to work would be the same as any\nother associate under similar circumstances.\n1.4 INTERMITTENT LEAVE (MULTIPLE ABSENCES FOR THE SAME REASON)\n1.4.1 Leave may be available on an intermittent or reduced work schedule basis,\nonly as required by law. Requests for intermittent time off will be handled on a\ncase-by-case basis in accordance with applicable laws.\n1.4.2 Associates must give 30 days\u2019 notice of the need for an intermittent leave, and unless\notherwise limited by law, may not take intermittent absences until the leave is\napproved. I f 30 days\u2019 notice is not practicable; notice must be given as soon as\npracticable.\n1.4.3 Under FMLA, some special rules apply to intermittent absences:\n29\n1.4.3.1 Associates must make a reasonable effort to arrange scheduled\nintermittent absences so as not to unduly interrupt MDB\u2019s operations.\n1.4.3.2 MDB may require associates to transfer temporarily to another position for which\nthe\nassociate is qualified, that would provide equivalent pay and benefits and better\naccommodate scheduled intermittent absences.\n1.4.3.3 Associates must comply with MD Billing\u2019 usual and customary policies for\nreporting leaves and absences, including \u201ccall in\u201d and other absence\nreporting\nprocesses. If an associate does not comply with the employer\u2019s usual notice\nandprocedural requirements, and no unusual circumstances justify the failure to\ncomply, the associate may be subject to attendance discipline.\n1.4.3.4 Intermittent absences may be approved only as estimated by a health care\nprovider.\nIf the frequency or duration of absences exceeds the provider\u2019s estimate, MDB\nwill require a new certification.\n1.4.3.5 MDB may seek a second opinion when certifying an intermittent absence, if MDB\nhas reason to doubt the value of the certification. An example of when a second\nopinion may be sought is when a pattern of absences is evident, and this is\ndifferent than what the provider estimated (for example, if absences frequently\nhappen on the same day of the week, or time of day). In a case where the\nsecond opinion differs\nfrom the first opinion, MDB may obtain the opinion of a third health care provider,\ndesignated or approved by MDB and the associate.\n1.4.3.6 The amount of leave available on an intermittent basis depends on the\nassociate\u2019s scheduled work hours. For associates with a variable (changing)\nwork schedule, a 12-week average of scheduled work hours will be used. Under\nFMLA the amount of leave available is calculated by multiplying average\nscheduled weekly work hours by\n12. For example, an associate who works 30 hours a week has 360 hours of\nFMLA available. This calculation is made when a new leave is approved and is\nheld constant for that leave. Should the associate apply for another leave, for\nanother reason, the amount of available leave may be adjusted to reflect\nchanges to the associate\u2019s scheduled work hours.\n1.5 APPLYING FOR A LEAVE\n1.5.1 Associates are required to give at least 30 days\u2019 notice of their desire to take a\nleave of absence by contacting the Human Resources department at (806) 712-\n1096.\n1.5.2 If the need for leave is unforeseeable, associates must give notice as soon as\npossible. Failure to give timely notice could result in postponement or denial of\nthe requested leave. If no PTO is available, the leave will be unpaid.\n1.5.3 Associates must report absences in accordance with MDB attendance policies.\nFailure to do so, even if the leave is protected under FMLA, may result in\nattendance discipline to the extent that the law allows.\n1.6 WHILE ON LEAVE\n1.6.1 MDB may request additional information or medical certification during the course\n30\nof a leave. Associates must promptly respond to these requests, or, to the extent al\nlowed by law, further leave may be denied or delayed.\n1.6.2 If the circumstances of the leave change, such as the expected return date or the\nnature of a medical condition, associates are required to contact the Human\nResources department as soon as possible.\n1.6.3 All requests for internal transfers while on an approved leave of absence\nmust be submitted to and approved by the Human Resources department.\n1.6.4 While on leave, the associate may not engage in other work or employment\nwithout notif ication and approval from MDB.\n1.7 RECERTIFICATION OF LEAVES UNDER FMLA\n1.7.1 Recertification may be required every thirty (30) days and/or under the\nfollowing circumstances:\n1.7.1.1 The associate requests an extension of leave;\n1.7.1.2 Circumstances described by the original certification have changed significantly\n(e.g., the duration of the illness, the nature of the illness, complications);\n1.7.1.3 MDB receives information that casts doubt upon the continuing validity of the\ncertification;\n1.8 RETURNING FROM LEAVE\n1.8.1 Associates on a continuous leave of absence must notify MDB at least one week\nbefore their scheduled return date to confirm their status and intent to return to\nwork by calling the Human Resources department.\n1.8.2 Associates returning from a leave taken for their own serious health condition\nmust submit a Return to Work Release from their health care provider authorizing\ntheir return to work.\n1.8.3 Prior to returning to work from any type of leave absence, associates must be\ncurrent on all licensure and certifications required to perform the essential functions\nof their position. If an associate\u2019s licensure or certification is expired, they will be\nplaced on an unpaid administrative leave for 30 days or until licenses and/or\ncertifications are current, in accordance with MDB policy.\n1.9 FAILURE TO RETURN TO WORK\n1.9.1 If the associate is not able to or does not wish to return to work at the end of the\napproved leave, the associate may apply for an extension by contacting the HR\ndepartment. Extensions will be considered on a case-by-case basis. MDB reserves\nthe right to grant or deny such requests in its sole discretion in compliance with\napplicable law and its own policies.\n1.9.2 It is the associate\u2019s responsibility to report to work at the end of the approved leave.\nFailure to return to work at the scheduled end of the leave or to obtain an extension\nof the leave will be considered a voluntary resignation of employment.\n2. Detailed Policy: Leave for the Associate\u2019s Own Serious Health Condition,\nexcluding Pregnancy\n2.1 PURPOSE\n31\nMDB offers eligible associates a leave of absence for their own illness or injury. This\nincludes work-related illness and injury. This leave may be provided in two segments:\n\u2022 The associate is eligible for leave under the Family & Medical Leave Act of 1993.\n(FMLA), the first portion of the leave, typically up to 12 work weeks in a rolling\nback 12-month period, will be provided as required under these laws.\n\u2022 Following exhaustion of FMLA, or if the associate is not eligible for FMLA, the\nremainder of leave may be provided under MDB\u2019s Medical Leave or as an ADA\naccommodation. See Medical Leve section for more information.\n2.2 ELIGIBILIITY FOR LEAVE\n2.2.1 To be eligible for leave under FMLA, an associate:\n\u2022 must have worked at MDB for at least 12 months (these 12 months need\nnot be consecutive), and\n\u2022 must have worked a minimum of 1,250 hours in the 12 months\nimmediately prior to the f irst day of the requested leave, and\n\u2022 must be employed at a worksite that employs 50 or more associates\nwithin 75 miles of the associate\u2019s worksite.\n2.2.2 To be eligible for leave under the MDB Medical Leave policy, an associate:\n\u2022 Must be a full- or part-time associate who has been employed with MDB\nfor at least 6 consecutive months, and\n\u2022 Must not otherwise be eligible for leave under FMLA (for example, the\nassociate is not eligible for FMLA or has exhausted leave under those\nlaws).\n\u2022 In the event that an associate has been an associate of MDB for less\nthan 6 consecutive months, medical leave is available only as a\nreasonable accommodation under ADA, or on a case-by-case basis is\napproved by the associate\u2019s department Director and Human\nResources.\n2.3 QUALITIFICATIONS FOR LEAVE\n2.3.1 FMLA leave may be taken because the associate is incapacitated f rom his/her\nown job due to an illness or injury.\n2.3.2 To support a request for FMLA leave, the associate must provide medical certification\nfrom a health care provider, no later than 15 calendar days after it is requested by\nMDB. See MDB Medical Leave section for information on qualifying for leave not\ncovered by FMLA.\n2.4 LEAVE AVAILABLE\n2.4.1 Eligible associates who qualify for FMLA leave are entitled to 12 work weeks of\nFMLA leave in a rolling back 12-month period. MDB defines this period as the 12\nmonths immediately prior to the f irst day of the requested leave.\n\u2022 Available FMLA leave time will be calculated by subtracting any FMLA\nleave the associate has taken during the preceding 12 months.\n\u2022 This 12-work week entitlement includes leave taken for any reason\nunder FMLA.\n2.4.2 If an associate has exhausted FMLA, or is not eligible for FMLA, additional leave may\nbe\n32\noffered under the MDB medical leave section, or as an ADA accommodation. The\namount of leave available will be determined on a case-by-case basis. Available\nFMLA leave time will be calculated by subtracting any FMLA leave the associate\nhas taken during the preceding 12 months.\n2.5 JOB PROTECTION WHILE ON LEAVE\n2.5.1 If an associate returns from a leave protected under FMLA and has not exceeded\nthe maximum leave entitlement under those laws, the associate will be returned to\nhis or her previous position under those laws, the associate will be returned to his\nor her previous position or an equivalent position.\n2.5.2 Once FMLA leave is exhausted, MDB is unable to guarantee job protection\nand reinstatement in all cases.\n3. Detailed Policy: Pregnancy Disability Leave\n3.1 PURPOSE\n3.1.1 MDB offers time off for pregnancy and childbirth, which typically consist of\ntwo components:\n\u2022 Leave taken when an associate is disabled due to pregnancy, childbirth,\nor a related serious health condition, covered under this policy; and\n\u2022 Leave taken to spend time with the newborn child, covered under\nthe Parenting Leave section.\n3.2 ELIGIBILITY\n3.2.1 To be eligible for pregnancy disability leave under FMLA, an associate must have\nworked at MDB for at least 12 months and worked a minimum of 1,250 hours in the\n12 months immediately prior to the f irst day of the requested leave.\n3.2.2 Associates who are not eligible for, or have exhausted, FMLA and/or PDL may be\neligible\nfor leave under the MDB Medical Leave section, or as an ADA accommodation.\n3.3 LEAVE AVAILABLE\n3.3.1 Eligible associates who qualify for FMLA leave are entitled to 12 work weeks of\nFMLA leave in a rolling back 12-month period. MDB defines this period as the 12\nmonths immediately prior to the f irst day of the requested leave.\n\u2022 Available FMLA leave time will be calculated by subtracting any FMLA\nleave the associate has taken during the preceding 12 months.\n\u2022 This 12-work week entitlement includes leave taken for any reason\nunder FMLA.\n3.3.2 The maximum amount of leave available to associates who are not eligible for, or\nhave exhausted, FMLA will be determined on a case-by-case basis under the MDB\nMedical Leave policy.\n3.4 JOB PROTECTION WHILE ON LEAVE\n3.4.1 If an eligible associate returns f rom a leave protected by FMLA and has not\nexceeded the maximum leave entitlement under those laws, they will be returned to\nher previous position or an equivalent position.\n33\n3.4.2 Once FMLA is exhausted, MDB is unable to guarantee job protection and\nreinstatement in all cases. If the associate is on an approved leave, at the conclusion\nof leave, MDB will reinstate her to the same or similar position, if available.\n4. Detailed Policy: Parenting Leave\n4.1 PURPOSE\n4.1.1 MDB offers time to spend time with a new child, including a child who is adopted or\nplaced for foster care. Parenting Leave must be completed within 12 months of the\nchild\u2019s birth or placement.\n4.2 ELIGIBILITY\n4.2.1 To be eligible for leave under FMLA, an associate must have worked at MDB for at\nleast 12 months and worked a minimum of 1,250 hours in the previous 12 months\nimmediately prior to the f irst day of the requested leave.\n4.2.2 An associate who is not eligible for FMLA may apply for Personal Leave to spend\ntime with a new child.\n4.3 COVERED RELATIONSHIPS\n4.3.1 For purposes of FMLA, child means a biological, adopted or foster child, a stepchild,\na legal ward, or a child of a person standing in loco parentis, who is either under age\n18, or\nage 18 or older and \u201cincapable of self -care because of a mental or physical\ndisability\u201d at the time that FMLA leave is to commerce.\n4.3.2 Federal FMLA regulations define in loco parentis as including those with day -to-day\nresponsibilities to care for and/or financially support a child.

The organization mandates that users adhere to the following guidelines on password\nconstruction:\n\u2022 Passwords must be at least 12 characters.\n\u2022 Passwords must be comprised of a mix of upper- and lower-case characters.\n\u2022 Passwords must not be single words that can be found in a dictionary (passphrases are ok).\n\u2022 Passwords must not be comprised of an obvious keyboard sequence (i.e., qwerty)\n\u2022 Passwords must not include \"guessable\" data such as personal information about yourself,\nyour spouse, your pet, your children, birthdays, addresses, phone numbers, locations, etc.\n\u2022 Ideally, place yourself in a well-known area (your office, living room, etc) and pick 4 unrelated,\nrandom objects. That\u2019s your password. By using a familiar space, you can easily place\nyourself back in the situation and recall what you picked, making your password easy to\nremember.\n57\nConfidentiality\nPasswords are considered confidential data and treated with the same discretion as any of the\norganization's proprietary information. The following guidelines apply to the confidentiality of\norganization passwords:\n\u2022 Users must not disclose their passwords to anyone.\n\u2022 Users must not share their passwords with others (co-workers, supervisors, family, etc.).\n\u2022 Users must not write down their passwords and leave them unsecured.\n\u2022 Users must not check the \"save password\" box when authenticating to applications.\n\u2022 Users must not use the same password for different systems and/or accounts.\n\u2022 Users must not send passwords via email.\n\u2022 Users must not re-use passwords.\nChange Frequency\nTo maintain good security, passwords must be periodically changed.

The organization may use software that enforces this policy by\nexpiring users' passwords after this time period. When selecting a new password, users must not\nselect a password that is substantially the same as, or similar to, the previous password.\nComputer Security and Copying of Software\nSoftware programs purchased and provided by the Company are to be used only for creating,\nresearching, and processing Company-related materials.

Determined by the nature of these events, it may be the case that these social events are attended\nby clients, suppliers and associates alike. This policy sets out parameters and procedures for such events.\nNothing in this policy should be read to limit the rights of associates under federal, state or local labor and\nemployment laws. Further, the Company reserves its right to maintain and enforce valid no-solicitation and\nno-distribution rules consistent with federal labor laws.\nAlthough such social events will usually take place away from the workplace and may fall outside of normal\nworking hours, the Company's standard code of conduct applies to such events. Whilst it is not the\nCompany\u2019s intention to place unnecessary restrictions on associates' enjoyment at such events, for the\navoidance of doubt, it is in everyone's interest that certain rules of conduct for the protection and comfort of\nall are observed.\nAssociates who attend work-related social events must observe and respect to the following guidelines and\nprinciples:\n64\n\u2022 Improper or other unacceptable behavior will not be tolerated.\n\u2022 Alcohol should only be consumed in moderation at work-related social events, regardless and\nirrespective of whether the Company, client or supplier is providing or paying for the drinks.\n\u2022 It is strictly forbidden for any associate to engage in the use or supply of illegal drugs, including\ncannabis, at any work-related social event whether on Company premises or not.\n\u2022 The Company's policy on harassment and bullying applies to work-related social events.\n\u2022 Associates should not say or do anything at a work-related social event that could offend, intimidate,\nembarrass or upset any other person, whether as a joke or not.\n\u2022 Swearing and intemperate language are unacceptable at work-related social events.\n\u2022 Associates must not behave in any way at any work-related social event that could bring the\nCompany, its clients or suppliers name into disrepute.\nAny breach of the above rules will render the associate liable to disciplinary action under the Company's\ndisciplinary procedure, up to and including summary dismissal where any offence is deemed to constitute\ngross misconduct. Unacceptable behavior that might result in a gross misconduct dismissal would include\nexcessive drunkenness, the use or distribution of illegal drugs, unlawful or inappropriate harassment,\nviolence, serious verbal abuse, or assault of either another associate or a third party such as a guest or a\nmember of the waiting or bar staff.\nAssociates are expected to conduct themselves behaviorally and socially as they would in a workplace\nsetting. Managers alike are expected to intervene as necessary if conduct becomes unprofessional. These\nguidelines and principles are in place for the benefit of all associates and to ensure that everyone can enjoy\nwork-related social events in a friendly, welcomed and pleasant atmosphere, without fear of being made to\nfeel uncomfortable by another associate's conduct.\nHealth & Safety\nIn accordance with the Company\u2019s health and safety policy, you have a general duty to take reasonable\ncare of your own health and safety and that of others who may be affected by your acts or omissions.\nPlease bear this in mind when consuming alcohol.\nTravel\nAssociates who intend to drive following a social event, should take all necessary and appropriate steps to\nensure that they are well within the legal limits to be driving.

The Company strives to anticipate and manage\ncrisis situations in order to reduce disruption to our associates and to maintain our reputation as a high-\nquality company.\nIn order to avoid providing inaccurate, incomplete or Material Information to outside sources, all outside\ninquiries regarding the Company or its associates, directors or officers or operations must be referred\nto an Authorized Spokesperson.

The Company encourages a system of\nprogressive discipline depending on the type of prohibited conduct. However, the Company is not\nrequired to engage in progressive discipline and may discipline or terminate an associate where they\nviolate the rules of conduct or where the quality or value of the associate\u2019s work fails to meet\nexpectations at any time.\nAgain, any attempt at progressive discipline does not imply that your employment is anything other\nthan on an \u201cat will\u201d basis.\nDiscipline in the workplace is essential for the efficient and orderly operations of the business.\nDiscipline should never be used as punishment, but to correct an unacceptable behavior or poor work\nperformance. Associates are expected to demonstrate good judgment, ethical personal behavior and\ncommon sense. If your conduct as an associate comes into question, you can expect to be disciplined\nto correct the behavior. There are levels of discipline, which will give an associate an opportunity to\ncorrect behavior before imposing the most severe form of discipline, which is termination from\n66\nemployment.\nIn appropriate circumstances, management will provide the associate first with a verbal warning, then\nwith one or more written warnings, and if the conduct is not sufficiently altered, eventual demotion,\ntransfer, forced leave, or termination of employment. Your supervisor will make every effort possible to\nallow you to respond to any disciplinary action taken. Understand that while the Company is concerned\nwith consistent enforcement of our policies, the Company is not obligated to follow any disciplinary or\ngrievance procedure and that depending on the circumstances, associates may be disciplined or\nterminated without any prior warning or procedure.\nStandards of Conduct\nMD Billing wishes to create a work environment that promotes job satisfaction, respect, responsibility,\nintegrity, and value for all of our associates, clients, customers, and other stakeholders. Every\nassociate has a shared responsibility toward improving the quality of our work environment. By\ndeciding to work at this Company, you agree to follow the Company\u2019s rules.\nWhile it is impossible to list every item that could be considered misconduct in the workplace, what is\noutlined here is a list of common-sense infractions that could result in discipline, up to and including\nimmediate termination of employment. This policy is not intended to limit the Company\u2019s right to\ndiscipline or discharge associates for any reason permitted by law. In fact, while we value our\nassociates, the Company retains the right to terminate an associate on an \u201cat-will\u201d basis.\nGeneral Standards of Conduct\nThe following standards are common sense rules that, when violated, will result in the opportunity for\nthe associate to change their behavior, but will subject the associate to termination if, after given an\nopportunity, their conduct does not improve.\n\u2022 Associates must be at their workstations prepared to work at the beginning of their shift.\n\u2022 Associates are not permitted to conduct personal or non-work-related business at the work site\nbefore or after their shift.\n\u2022 Failure to dress according to company policy\n\u2022 Each associate is responsible for his / her time records.\n\u2022 Associates must notify their supervisor when they are unable to report to work on time.\n\u2022 Smoking is permitted in designated areas only.\n\u2022 Associates must follow safety policies and procedures.\n\u2022 Associates must use personal protective equipment (PPE) if required, in their work area.\n\u2022 All injuries must be reported regardless of how minor they appear.\n\u2022 All fire regulations must be observed.\n\u2022 Associates are not allowed to work overtime, unless approved by their supervisor.\n\u2022 Mechanical breakdown of equipment must be reported.\n\u2022 Tools must be maintained in serviceable condition and used properly.\n\u2022 Company owned or leased vehicles must be inspected daily before use.\n\u2022 Housekeeping is an associate\u2019s responsibility; keep your work area clean.\n\u2022 Under no circumstances are you permitted to leave your department position without prior\napproval from your supervisor.\n\u2022 Associates are required to keep all correspondence and interaction at the workplace site and\nduring work hours limited to business only.\n\u2022 Representatives visit our clinics from drug and pharmaceutical companies, home health\nagencies, DME agencies, product vendor agencies, services providing agencies and so on.\nAssociates are not allowed to interact and/or correspond with the aforementioned\nrepresentative(s) unless directed and authorized by their supervisor.\nNothing in this policy is intended to limit associate rights under the National Labor Relations Act.\nMajor Standards of Conduct\nThe following conduct may result in immediate termination without the benefit of progressive discipline.\n67\nViolations of these standards are considered unforgivable and an opportunity to correct the\nunacceptable behavior may not be offered.\n\u2022 Theft of company property\n\u2022 Theft of fellow associate\u2019s property\n\u2022 Submitting a false record of hours worked\n\u2022 Willful destruction of company property\n\u2022 Conviction of a major crime\n\u2022 Falsifying employment information\n\u2022 Disclosure of Company trade secrets and proprietary and confidential information of the\nCompany or its customers, contractors, suppliers, or vendors.\n\u2022 Refusal or failure to follow directions or to perform a requested or required job task\n\u2022 Refusal or failure to follow safety rules and procedures\n\u2022 Excessive tardiness or absences\n\u2022 Lending keys or key cards to Company property to unauthorized persons\n\u2022 Gross misconduct: outrageous behavior serious enough to warrant dismissal\n\u2022 Deliberate violation of safety rules\n\u2022 Offensive or indecent personal conduct between associates and/or with patients that is\ndisruptive to the company business, including the use of obscene or harassing language.\n\u2022 Falsifying company records\n\u2022 Job abandonment\n\u2022 Conflict of interest\n\u2022 In order to improve efficiency, profitability, and quality patient care outcomes associates may\nbe transferred from one business location/clinic to another on a periodic basis. When an\nassociate, assigned to be transferred from one clinic to another, refuses to be transferred, it\nwill be considered as an associate\u2019s willful separation from employment, and will also be\nconsidered as job abandonment.\n\u2022 Exhibition of low standard(s) of performance.\n\u2022 Carelessness and negligence in completing task(s) and assignment(s), as assigned by the\nsupervisor, in a timely, efficient, and effective manner.\n\u2022 Accepting monetary gifts\n\u2022 Discussing patients\u2019 personal, private, health-related, and financial situation.\n\u2022 Insubordination: Associates are expected to follow the company\u2019s chain-of-command when\naddressing their grievances, concerns, and/or complaints. Not following the proper chain-of-\ncommand will be considered as insubordination and may lead to immediate termination.\nInsubordination is also considered to have occurred when the associate(s) unreasonably\nrefuses to obey orders or follow the instructions of their supervisor(s). It also is considered to\nhave occurred when the associate(s), through his/her actions or words, shows disrespect\ntoward his/her supervisor(s).\n\u2022 An associate who calls their supervisor stating that they will be coming late to work but does\nnot show up to work at all and does not notify that they will be absent for rest of the day will be\nsubject to disciplinary action up to and/or including termination.\nProgressive Discipline\nWhen an associate has been found to have violated one of the General Standards of Conduct or has\nexhibited a low standard of work performance, they may be disciplined using progressive discipline.\nThis process is normally used for violations that are less serious in nature and where unforeseen\ncircumstances may have influenced the associate\u2019s conduct. When applying this process, the\nassociate must be made to understand specifically what standard was violated, what actions are\nrequired to correct the behavior, and what action will be taken if the behavior is not corrected. MD\nBilling reserves the sole discretion in determining when and how progressive discipline will be\ndelivered and at what step disciplined will be administered.\n1st Offense: Verbal Warning\nAssociate is counseled and signs the disciplinary action form. (Associate should be told what his/her\n68\nconduct was, the steps needed to correct it, and how long they have to make the correction).\n2nd Offense: Written Warning\nThe unacceptable conduct was not corrected, and this is the second warning. Explain what actions are\nneeded to correct the conduct and how long they have to make the correction. Explain that the next\nwarning will result in termination. This written document (associate signed) will be placed in the\nassociate\u2019s personnel file.\n3rd Offense: Written Warning with Termination\nExplain that the associate\u2019s conduct has not improved, and they are being terminated. Document this\naction and place it in the associate\u2019s personnel file.\nUnpaid Suspension from Work\nAs part of the disciplinary process, associate(s) could be suspended from work without pay for up to\nthree days at any time during the progressive discipline process.\nNote: The foregoing Standards of Conduct are not intended to be inclusive of the required discipline,\nproper standards of conduct or obligations which associates must observe at all times. The Standards\nof Conduct are not intended to limit the proper rights of anyone but are intended to protect the rights of\neveryone. The company may utilize the procedure to follow the progressive discipline process, but it\ndoes not have to follow the sequence described above.\nImmediate Suspension and/or Termination\nIf an associate violates one of the Major Standards of Conduct, they are subject to immediate termination.\nThe supervisor may suspend the associate pending investigation and review by the Human Resources\nDepartment. The Human Resources representative will notify the associate of which Standard of Conduct\nthey violated and will take a statement from them and any witnesses, if present, that observed the action.\nWhen possible, have a witness sign the appropriate column on the Corrective Action form. In the event\nof termination, the associate will be paid any wages due in accordance with the appropriate State Payday\nLaw.\nIn the event an associate is perceived to be inappropriately terminated, the associate has the right and\nresponsibility of filing a grievance, following the Grievance Procedure, with the Human Resource\nDepartment. The associate must make a statement in writing to the Human Resources Department within\n3 days of termination. The Human Resources Department, in conjunction with the Executive team will\nmake a determination within 7 days of receipt of the grievance.\nGrievance Procedure\nMD Billing recognizes that there are times when the need arises for associates to express concerns or\ncomplaints in a formal manner. The following procedures will ensure that associates receive a fair and\nunbiased review of workplace concerns. Instances where this procedure may be effective includes\nharassment, inappropriate conduct, non-compliance or unreasonable disciplinary action/termination.\nProcedures\nStep 1: Informal discussion with supervisor\nAssociate concerns should first be discussed with the associate's immediate supervisor. Many concerns\ncan be resolved informally when an associate and supervisor take time to review the concern and discuss\noptions to address the issue.\nStep 2: Written complaint to supervisor\nIf the associate is not satisfied with the results of the informal discussion in Step 1, the associate may\nsubmit a written complaint within five days to his or her immediate supervisor to include:\n69\nThe nature of the grievance.\nDetailed information including evidence of the issue, witnesses, related policies, etc.\nThe remedy or outcome desired.\nThe immediate supervisor will have five working days to respond to the associate in writing.\nIf the associate complaint is regarding illegal harassment, discrimination or retaliation, the associate\nshould submit the written complaint directly to Human Resources.\nStep 3: Written complaint to senior management\nIf the associate is not satisfied with the response from the immediate supervisor, the associate may\nsubmit a written complaint to senior management for review. A copy should also be sent to Human\nResources. The request for review should include:\nAn explanation of the grievance and details of all previous efforts to resolve the issue.\nA copy of the written complaint submitted to the immediate supervisor.\nA copy of the immediate supervisor's written response to the associate's complaint.\nDetailed information regarding the associate's dissatisfaction with the immediate supervisor's\nresponse.\nSenior management will consult with the associate's immediate supervisor, Human Resources and any\nother relevant parties to evaluate the grievance and provide a written response to the associate within\nfive days. The outcome of the review by senior management will be final unless new evidence or other\ncircumstances warrant additional review of the complaint.\nRecordkeeping\nHuman resources will maintain records of the grievance process confidentially and securely.\nTobacco and Vape-Free Workplace Policy\nMD Billing is concerned about the effect that smoking and secondhand smoke inhalation can have on its\nassociates and clients. Smoking in the office, client areas, and restrooms is strictly prohibited. This policy\nincludes traditional smoking and the use of alternate nicotine delivery system and electronic smoking\ndevices such as e-cigarettes, e-pipe, e-hookahs, e-cigars or any such device.\nSmoking is prohibited except for in designated areas and on break or meal periods.\nDrug and Alcohol Policy\nMD Billing considers drug and alcohol abuse a serious matter that will not be tolerated. The Company\nabsolutely prohibits associates from using, selling, possessing, or being under the influence of illegal\ndrugs, alcohol, or a controlled substance or prescription drug not medically authorized while at their\njob, on Company property, or while on work time.\nTherefore, it is the Company\u2019s policy that:\n\u2022 You may not report to work under the inf luence of alcohol, illegal drugs, or any controlled\nsubstance or prescription drug not medically authorized.\n\u2022 You may not possess or use alcohol, illegal drugs, or any controlled substance or prescription\ndrug not medically authorized while on company property or on company business.\nThe Company also cautions against the use of prescribed or over-the-counter medication, which can\naffect your ability to perform your job safely, or the use of prescribed or over-the-counter medication in\na manner violating the recommended dosage or instructions from the doctor. You must have a valid\n70\nprescription for any prescription medication used while working for the Company. Inform your\nsupervisor prior to working under the influence of a prescribed or over-the-counter medication that may\naffect your ability to perform your job safely. If the Company determines that the prescribed or over-\nthe-counter medication does not pose a safety risk, you will be allowed to work. Failure to comply with\nthese guidelines concerning prescription or over-the-counter medication may result in disciplinary\naction, up to and including termination of employment.\nSubstance Abuse Policy\nAssociate drug abuse has become a major problem for employers. A person who abuses substances\nendangers not only him or herself but also endangers everyone they encounter. This company has an\nobligation to ensure a drug and alcohol-free workplace. To satisfy our obligation to provide a drug and\nalcohol-free workplace, mandatory testing may be required in the following circumstances:\n\u2022 Whenever a supervisor observes an individual behaving in a suspect manner\n\u2022 Whenever a person is involved in an incident or accident\n\u2022 Randomly at the discretion of management\n\u2022 When associate returns to work after recovering from a workplace injury.\nDrug testing will be done at company expense.

If an applicant\u2019s test is\npositive, they will not be considered for employment at that time and will be informed that they have\nfailed to meet the medical standards.\nTesting of Associate \u2013 Selection Procedures:\nFor Cause Testing: Current associates will be asked to submit to a test if cause exists to indicate that\n71\ntheir health or ability to perform work may be impaired.

At that point, if their drug test\nresult is positive, they will be terminated immediately.\nOther Testing Programs: Associates may be required to submit to drug testing when required by\nfederal or state law, regulation or by contracted obligation not otherwise anticipated by provision of this\npolicy.

Any\ndisciplinary action is not dependent upon the disposition of any case in court.\nAssociates are expected to be on the job, ready to work, when scheduled.
