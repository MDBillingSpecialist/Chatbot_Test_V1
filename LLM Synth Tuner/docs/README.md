Overview
This project is designed to automate the process of segmenting documents, generating questions and answers, and preparing a dataset for fine-tuning machine learning models. The pipeline integrates document segmentation with LLaMA-based subtopic, question, and response generation. The final output is a structured dataset ready for model training.

Features
Document Segmentation: Automatically segments PDF documents based on a predefined Table of Contents (TOC) structure.
Q&A Generation: Uses advanced language models to generate subtopics, questions, and multiple responses for each segment of the document.
End-to-End Pipeline: Combines segmentation and Q&A generation into a seamless workflow, outputting structured data for fine-tuning.
Modular Design: Easily extend or modify each module to suit specific needs.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.8+
Virtual environment (optional but recommended)
API keys for NVIDIA and OpenAI services
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/my_project.git
cd my_project
Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
Install the dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up environment variables:

Create an .env file in the env/ directory:
ini
Copy code
NVIDIA_API_KEY=your-nvidia-api-key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
DEBUG=True
Ensure that this .env file is configured correctly with your API keys.
Running the Project
Segment a PDF Document:

Update the Table of Contents structure in src/integration.py with your document's TOC.
Run the segmentation process:
bash
Copy code
python src/integration.py
The segmented output will be saved in the data/processed/ directory.
Generate Q&A Data:

The integration script will automatically generate subtopics, questions, and responses for each segment.
The final Q&A dataset will be saved in the data/output/ directory.
View Logs:

Check logs/processing_log.txt for detailed logs of the process.
Testing
Run unit tests to ensure the project is functioning correctly:

bash
Copy code
pytest tests/
Usage
For detailed usage instructions, including examples and API details, refer to the USAGE.md and API.md files in the docs/ directory.
